<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Developer:</strong> PlayTechCorner<br>
<strong>App:</strong> Crazy Dragon Tools<br>
<strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 2025</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
Crazy Dragon Tools (“the App”), developed by PlayTechCorner (“we”, “our”, or “us”), is a utility mobile application.
This Privacy Policy explains how the App collects, uses, and protects user data.
</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>2.1 Data You Provide</h3>
<p>
The App does not collect personal information.  
All clan data, donation logs, and app settings are stored locally on your device using offline storage (Hive).  
This data is never transmitted to PlayTechCorner or any external server.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Automatically Collected Data (via AdMob)</h3>
<p>
The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may automatically collect:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Device or other identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID)</li>
<li>IP address</li>
<li>Approximate device activity related to ads</li>
</ul>

<p>AdMob collects this information for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising and marketing</li>
<li>Fraud prevention, security, and compliance</li>
</ul>

<p>
PlayTechCorner does not receive, store, or process this information.

</p>

<h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
<p>
All app data is stored locally on the user's device only.  
No information is uploaded to external servers.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
PlayTechCorner does not sell, trade, or share any user data.  
The only data processed externally is through Google AdMob as described above.
</p>

<h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
This app is not designed for children under 13.  
AdMob automatically manages child-directed compliance where required.
</p>

<h2>6. Security</h2>
<p>
Because all user data is stored locally, you maintain full control of your information.
We do not collect or transmit any sensitive data.
</p>

<h2>7. User Controls</h2>
<p>
Users may:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Reset the Advertising ID from their device settings</li>
<li>Disable ad personalization through Google settings</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page.
